I'm an enthusiastic Data Scientist excited to work on augmentation of health sciences using big data and machine learning. I like working in a team and interacting with people. Being able to identify problems/questions and finding solutions to them is what excites me! I am self-motivated and have the proven ability to meet milestones and deliver results in a time bound manner that have led to the completion of 2 projects and 3 international publications. I possess strong communication skills as evidenced by 2 poster presentations, and 5 talks on national and international platforms during my PhD. In the field of Biology, I have worked on several different model systems giving me the ability to learn and adapt quickly. I am currently looking for opportunities in the filed of data science and eager to work in an energetic team.
